var myNum; //This opens a variable called myNum with no value
//There is no int or string, instead you have to be careful with declaring your variables

var string = "string"; //This is a string variable with the value "string"

myNum = 5; //Sets the value of myNum to 5

if (myNum == 5){
    //This checks if the value of myNum is equal to 5
    mynum += 1; //This is a shorthand way of writing myNum = myNum + 1;
