# ctoboeCode

This is a repository where I will upload all cool bits of code I'm working on, and other code I've finished

Contribute if you can, fix errors because there will be some (I guarrantee it), just not in the ToastOS files. I spend a lot of time making that work, and it would be nice if I didn't have to fix more errors.
