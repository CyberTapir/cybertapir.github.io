In reality this was made with COSMOS user kit.

It has  gone on hold, as the laptop I was using died, so I am waiting for Bootcamp to be fixed on Big Sur

Cosmos user kit isn't cross platform so it has gone on hold for a bit.

The .cs file is actually a .sln file, but is that so all the colours show up.(The colours really help)

Please don't touch any of the code.
